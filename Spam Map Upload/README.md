# Spam: Map Upload

# Description
With this script you can save a map thousands of time with random names and then upload all of the saved maps to as many servers as you wish.

# Installation
Copy the spam-map-upload.cfg file to your AssaultCube scripts folder.

# Usage

* Use ````mapSpamSaveMap <amount of saves>```` to save a map with random names a variable amount of times.
* Use ````mapSpamUploadMaps```` to upload the maps that you generated with mapSpamSaveMap.

Note:

* You will have to delete the random maps in your local maps folder manually
* Small maps can be uploaded faster and may be used to make a server reach the maximum amount of map uploads for one day
