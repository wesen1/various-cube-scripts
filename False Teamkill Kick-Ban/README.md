# False Teamkill Kick and Ban

# Description
With this script you can call votes to kick or ban players for teamkilling with a fake amount of teamkills.

# Installation
Copy the false-teamkill-kick-ban.cfg file to your AssaultCube scripts folder.

# Usage

* Use ````kickTeamKill <target cn> <fake amount teamkills>```` to call a vote to kick a player for a fake amount of teamkills.
* Use ````banTeamKill <target cb> <faje amount teamkills>```` to call a vote to ban a player for a fake amount of teamkills.

Note:

* If an admin is around you have no chance to use this trick
* When you are lagging the ping of the target in the reason will be wrong because to your client it seems like every one else is lagging. In that case people might notice that it is a fake vote.
