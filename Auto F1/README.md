# Auto F1

# Description
With this script you can instantly make votes pass by being connected to a server with multiple clients for which the autoF1 mode is activated.

# Installation
Copy the auto-F1.cfg file to your AssaultCube scripts folder.

# Usage

* Use ````setAutoF1 <auto F1 State>```` to de-/activate the auto F1 mode.
* After activating the auto F1 mode start other clients and connect them to the target server.

Note:

* This will vote F1 for every vote, even if it is called by a random player

# Ideas

* Add a bash script to auto start multiple clients that auto connect to a specific server
* Make clients vote F1 only on other troll clients F1 votes (by special names or ip)
* Make clients remote controllable (e.g. if you say "disconnect" make them disconnect)
